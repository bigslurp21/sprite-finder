How the program runs
--------------------

Idea:

The interface will communicate with the engine where the search window is at all times.

Every ___ milliseconds a snapchat will be taken of the search window, given that it was moving.
or
Movement triggers snapshots every ____ pixels.

This snapshot will be processed as quick as possible, which includes:
1) Send to AI to determine if it has seen an "interesting object"
2) Based on location weather that object has been seen before
3) If found it saves the location and type, then sends this information back to interface to be displayed.
